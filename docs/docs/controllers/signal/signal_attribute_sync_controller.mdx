## Purpose

A controller that responds to SignalInputController notifications.
This controller can update an attribute on the element it is mounted on, to the value of an input somewhere else on the page using a SignalInputController.

This controller can be anywhere in the DOM tree and it will receive notifications from any SignalInputController with
the same `nameValue` as the `nameValue` of this controller.

# Use Cases
To implement a filterable HTML table. You might implement a Stimulus controller that hides all rows of a column that
don't contain the given keyword(s). Those keywords are provided to the controller via a `data-table-filter-search-value`
attribute, which Stimulus is able to listen to and react to changes on.

You might then create a search box with an input field, that users can type into to update the filter.
So, you mount a SignalInputController on that input, so that anything that is typed into the box is signalled to other signal controllers listening
for the same `data-signal-input-name-value`.

You can then mount a SignalAttributeSyncController on the same table element as your TableFilterController, and give it
an attribute of `data-signal-attribute-sync-attribute-value="data-table-filter-search-value"`, and then everything typed into
your search form will live update the filter on your table.
